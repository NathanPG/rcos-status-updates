## Last Week's Accomplishments

Successfully set everything up.
I choose Pycharm and fix problems with the virtual environment and package errors.

## This Week's Plan

I am going to review the first test and planning to do the back-end part. 
This time I have what I learned last semester to help.

## Anything Blocking?

Time management.
