## Last Week's Accomplishments

I submitted the credit overflow request. 
This is the second semester in RCOS.

## This Week's Plan

 I am among the first three members in the group. 
 We made few options to decide what we are going to do this semester. 
 Instead learning from others, I can apply what I learned last semester.

## Anything Blocking?

It was late for me to submit the application, the dean gave my application to ALAC.
Hopefully they can get me approved to take RCOS.
