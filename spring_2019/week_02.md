## Last Week's Accomplishments

I got approved later last week. 
We voted and choose from the three options.

## This Week's Plan

I can start on the project. 
Because this is a new project we are thinking about the work assignment this week. 
I have setted up the environment and awaiting my teammates to decide the main structure.

## Anything Blocking?

I am waiting to be assigned work because it is not parallel work at the beginning.
