## Last Week's Accomplishments

This is the first week.

## This Week's Plan

I joined RPICourseTrend project following the lead by a senior student who was also my mentor. I am going to get familiar with my team and know what I can do and learn this semester.

## Anything Blocking?

This is the very fisrt time for me to join such open source program. And it is also the first time to work on the project in a team. I don't have many choice but learn what they write first, then optimize and write do what I can after I know what should I do next.
