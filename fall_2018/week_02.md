## Last Week's Accomplishments

I have met everyone in the team and know what they are interested in. I have talked to my friend, then set a general goal to learn back-end operations.

## This Week's Plan

We are going to have a group meeting and make sure everyone can find work that fits, then we work in smaller group in order to work in better efficiency. I will figure out which is easier to start to work on.

## Anything Blocking?

Limited experience, which means it is not easy to decide which part to learn first.
