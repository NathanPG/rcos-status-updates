## Last Week's Accomplishments

I decided to work with our back-end team which is lead by Ruijie Geng, who was a project leader last semester and has more than one-year experience on RCOS. 

## This Week's Plan

I have discussed with the leader. I am going to learn how to use crawler to get requested data first.

## Anything Blocking?

Need time to get familier with the imported packages.
